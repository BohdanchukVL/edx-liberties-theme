        <h1 id="C2">II. General information on data processing</h1>
        <h2>1. Scope of the processing of personal data</h2>
        <p>
          We normally only process the personal data of our users to the
          extent necessary to ensure the operation of our website, our content
          and our services. The processing of personal data of our users takes
          place regularly after consent of the user or due to our legitimate
          interests. An exception applies in those cases in which it is not
          possible to obtain prior consent for practical reasons and where the
          processing of the data is permitted by applicable law.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h2>
        <p>
          Where we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing
          of personal data, the legal basis shall be Article 6(1)(a) of the EU
          General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of
          personal data required for the fulfilment of a contract to which the
          data subject is a party. This also applies to any processing
          operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a
          legal obligation to which our organisation is subject, Article
          6(1)(c) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of
          our organisation or a third party and if the interests, fundamental
          rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh
          the first interest, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR shall serve as the legal
          basis for this processing.<br />
        </p>
        <h2>3. Data deletion and storage period</h2>
        <p>
          The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked
          as soon as the purpose of storage does not apply any more. In
          addition, the data may be stored if the European or national
          legislator has provided for this in EU regulations, laws or other
          provisions to which the controller is subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data shall also be blocked or deleted if a storage period
          prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless it is
          necessary to further store the data in order to conclude or fulfil a
          contract
        </p>
        <h1 id="C3">
          III. Provision of the website, provision of information via RSS feed
          and creation of log files
        </h1>
        <h2>1. Description and scope of data processing</h2>
        <p>
          Each time a user accesses our website, our system automatically
          collects data and information from the system of the accessing
          computer.
        </p>
        <p>The following data is collected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Date and time of the request</li>
          <li>Time zone difference to GMT</li>
          <li>Content of the website</li>
          <li>Access status (HTTP status)</li>
          <li>Transferred data volume</li>
          <li>Website from which you came to our website</li>
          <li>Web browser</li>
          <li>Operating system</li>
          <li>Browser language and version</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This happens both when you access our website directly and when you
          view our website content via an RSS feed.
        </p>
        <p>The data is also stored in the log files of our system.</p>
        <p>
          This data is not stored in conjunction with other personal data of
          the user.<br />
        </p>
        <h2>2. Legal basis for data processing</h2>
        <p>
          The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is
          Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The provision of personal data is partly in
          our legitimate interest and partly legally required (see point 5,
          paragraph Provider). It is not possible not to provide the data.
          Your only form of objection is by not visiting our website.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Purpose of data processing</h2>
        <p>
          In order to enable delivery of the website to the user's computer,
          the system needs to temporarily store the IP address. For this
          purpose, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the
          duration of the session.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same applies to the provision of website content via RSS feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is stored in log files in order to ensure the functionality of
          the website. The data is also used for optimising the website and to
          ensure the security of our IT systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use the log files on a daily basis to determine the total
          number of clearly identified visitors to our website. It is not
          possible to deduce information about individual visitors from this.
          We determine the total number of website visitors in order to
          compare it to the number of visitors who have agreed to our tracking
          of their visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          No further evaluation of the data for marketing purposes is carried
          out in this context.
        </p>
        <p>
          These purposes also include our legitimate interest in data
          processing according to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4. Categories of recipients of personal data and data processing
          outside of the European Union
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a rule, we do not pass on personal data to third parties unless
          we are obliged to do so by law or have obtained permission to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excluded from this is the involvement of service providers, e.g. for
          hosting the website, whom we have carefully selected with regard to
          data protection and for whom we have taken all measures required
          under data protection laws for legitimate data processing.

          Due to the integration of active content from service providers such
          as Facebook and YouTube, your data (specifically your IP address)
          will also be transferred to third countries when this content is
          accessed. More details on this can be found below in the notes on
          the individual providers,
          <a href="#C10">X – Embedded service providers.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>5. Duration of data storage</h2>
        <p>
          The data will be erased as soon as it is no longer needed for
          achieving the purpose for which it was collected. If the data has
          been collected in order to provide the website, this will be the
          case once the session has ended. The same applies to access via the
          RSS feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the data is stored in log files, the provider will anonymise the
          data after seven days.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to § 113 b TKG (Telecommunications Act), only the
          (telecommunications-) provider is obliged to store the Internet
          protocol address assigned to the subscriber (a unique identifier
          used for the Internet connection) as well as an assigned user
          identifier and date and time of the beginning and end of Internet
          use under the assigned Internet protocol address, stating the
          underlying time zone, for a period of ten weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longer storage times may be possible in connection with the
          prosecution of administrative criminal offences.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Objection and removal possibility</h2>
        <p>
          The collection of data for the provision of the website as well as
          the storage of data in log files are essential for the operation of
          the website. Consequently, there is no possibility for the user to
          object, except for the aforementioned non-usage of our website.

          You can revoke your consent to the donation (at least for recurring

          A revocation affects the personal data, which must be processed,
          used or transmitted for (contractual) payment processing, only after
          the expiry of legally prescribed retention periods. For this
          purpose, please use the information provided by Stripe and PayPal

        <p>
          The legal basis for the processing of the data transmitted in the
          course of an e-mail transmission is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If the
          purpose of the e-mail contact is the conclusion of a contract,

          achieving the purpose for which it was collected. For the personal
          data sent by e-mail or post, this is the case when the respective
          conversation with the user has ended. The conversation has ended
          once it can be inferred from the circumstances that the matter in
          question has been conclusively clarified. Further retention periods
          may result from the German Tax Code or the Commercial Code (§ 195
          BGB, 3-year regular limitation period).

          purpose, a new message via the contact form or a message by e-mail
          is sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user contacts us by e-mail, they can object to the storage of
          his personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation
          cannot be continued.

        <p>
          In this case, all personal data stored in the course of establishing
          contact will be deleted unless legal retention periods conflict with
          this. The same applies similarly to postal deliveries.

        <h2>2. Legal basis for data processing</h2>
        <p>
          Re 1: Address management and processing is part of the application
          process. The processing of your personal data is necessary to
          establish an employment relationship with you as the person
          concerned, therefore we process your data in accordance with Article
          6(1)(b) GDPR in conjunction with § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 German
          Data Protection Act (BDSG).
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 2: Since processing is necessary to establish an employment
          relationship with you as the data subject, we process your data in
          accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in conjunction with
        </p>
        <p>§ 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG.</p>
        <p>
          Re 3: According to § 670 BGB, applicants are legally entitled to
          reimbursement of the necessary interview costs if no provision has
          been made as to which costs for travel to the interview will be
          covered by the employer. Since the processing is necessary to
          conduct the interview and thus to establish an employment
          relationship with you as the person concerned, we process your data
          in accordance with Article 6(1)(b)GDPR in conjunction with § 26
          paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 4: We may use your personal data, which we have received during
          the application process, to assert, exercise or defend potential
          legal claims (e.g. if Liberties would be exposed to claims under the
          General Equal Treatment Act). The legal basis for the processing is
          Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Liberties has a legitimate interest in the use
          of personal data for the aforementioned reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 5: The data will be transferred to the personal file of the
          potential employee after recruitment. The legal basis for the
          processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in conjunction with Article 26
          paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 6: The processing is carried out to comply with or fulfil the
          legal obligation of the data subjects' rights under data protection
          law mentioned in Chapter III (Articles 12-22) GDPR, to which
          Liberties must comply as the responsible party within the meaning of
          Article 4(7)GDPR. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6
          (1)(c)GDPR.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Description of the categories of personal data</h2>
        <p>
          Re 1: Contact data (surname, first name, e-mail address, telephone
          number, address data, contact type, fax number), communication
          contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 2: Cover letter, curriculum vitae, photographs, certificates and
          other proofs of qualification as well as other data which were sent
          on a voluntary basis as part of the application process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 3: Travel data (e.g. arrival and departure, travel expenses,
          travel funds), bank details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 4: Master data, communication data, data to prove a legally
          compliant application process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 5: Master data, communication data, covering letter, curriculum
          vitae, photograph, certificates and other proofs of qualification as
          well as other data which were sent voluntarily within the scope of
          the application process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re 6: Declarations of revocation of any consent you may have given;
          declarations of objection which you may submit to the processing of
          your personal data; declarations and information which we receive
          from you for or in connection with the assertion of your data
          protection rights as specified in Chapter III (Articles 12-22) GDPR.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4. Categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or
          will be disclosed
        </h2>
        <p>
          Within Liberties, to those employees who need to receive the data in
          order to carry out the application process (management, specialist
          department, human resources department), as well as the telephone
          service used in the performance of our activities and the IT service
          providers with whom we have concluded appropriate contracts in order
          to ensure the protection of your personal data at all times and, if
          necessary, to the authorities for possible criminal investigations.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Storage duration</h2>
        <p>
          If Liberties has not recruited you after the application process has
          been completed, your data will be deleted within 6 months of the
          rejection of your application. If your application is successful and
          you are employed by Liberties, your personal data will be deleted
          once the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, at the
          latest after termination of the employment relationship (storage
          limitation), unless legal retention periods or legal limitation
          provisions preclude deletion.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Necessity of providing the data</h2>
        <p>
          The provision of your personal data is neither required by law nor
          by contract. However, the provision of your personal data is
          necessary for the execution of the application process. If you do
          not wish to make your personal data available, we will not be able
          to consider you for an application process at Liberties.

        <p>
          On our website, we offer you the opportunity to share these
          respective websites via social media. However, we only use share
          links to integrate social media. This means that your data is not
          automatically transferred to social media providers when you visit
          our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only if you follow the appropriate link are you directed to the

          URL of the respective website.
        </p>
        <p>

          our Facebook page, our Twitter account and our YouTube account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Right to rectification</h2>
        <p>
          With due regard to the provisions of Article 16 of the GDPR, you
          have the right to have your personal data corrected and/or completed
          by the data controller if the processed personal data relating to
          you is inaccurate or incomplete. The data controller must rectify
          the data immediately.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Right to restriction of processing</h2>
        <p>
          With due regard to the provisions of Article 18 of the GDPR, you may

        <p>
          If you have exercised your right to rectify, cancel or limit the
          processing of your personal data against the controller, the latter
          is obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have
          been disclosed of this rectification, cancellation or limitation,
          unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to be informed of these recipients vis-à-vis the
          data controller pursuant to Article 19 of the GDPR.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Right to data portability</h2>
        <p>
          With due regard to the requirements of Article 20 of the GDPR, you
          have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you
          have provided to the controller in a structured, commonly used and
          machine-readable format.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Right to object</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right, subject to the conditions of Article 21 of the
          GDPR, to object at any time, for reasons arising from your
          particular situation, to the processing of your personal data under
          Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, even if the profiling is based on these
          provisions.

        <p>
          You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data
          protection law at any time. The revocation of your consent does not
          affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of
          your consent up to the point of revocation.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Right of appeal to a supervisory authority</h2>
        <p>
          Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy,
          you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in

          of your personal data is in breach of the GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The supervisory authority where the complaint was lodged will inform
